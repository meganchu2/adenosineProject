The code for this analysis can be run in the R working environment.  It compares the expession of genes specified in the 'genes' list between cancers in the 'cancers' list.  The 'genes' and 'cancers' list can be edited to perform anova and Tukey testing on data you are interested in.  The 'geneName' variable can be edited to match the gene IDs in the 'genes' variable.  The nested for loops in the code parse the expression files for each cancer, filters for data from tumor samples, extracts the expression data for the gene of interest, and adds this data to a combined matrix with data for the specific gene from each cancer.  The second half of the code creates a box-and-whisker plot comparing the specified gene's expression in each cancer, performs an ANOVA test to detect any differences in the specified gene's expression between cancers, and performs a Tukey test to determine which cancers have significant differences in the specified gene's expression.
